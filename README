+About
Enables perks when using non whitelisted content.  This is designed to be a light weight perk replacement mod so perk 
progression is not saved.

+Version
1.0

+Check Sum
The check sum for the package is generated with the following command from the system folder:
         ucc.exe Editor.CheckSumPackageCommandlet KFPerkEnabler.u

If the output does not match any of the hashes in this README, you do not have an official version from me.
